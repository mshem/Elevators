Elevators by Michael Shemesh

This project has four main classes, Building, Elevator, Person, and Floor.
A building has many of the other classes, and they each belong to the building. 
Each floor can have many elevators, but elevators may only be on a single floor at once.
An elevator can have many people, but each person can only be on a single elevator at once.
People have a current floor and an intended floor.
